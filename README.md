Intersection Observer API
This code demonstrates the use of the Intersection Observer API to detect when an element becomes visible or hidden in the viewport. It allows you to perform certain actions or apply styles to the element based on its visibility.

Usage
Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file. For example, you can place it inside a <script> tag or link an external JavaScript file.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Intersection Observer API</title>
    <style>
        .visible_class {
            /* Add your styles for visible elements here */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Add elements with the 'target' class that you want to observe -->
    <div class="target"></div>
    <script src="your-script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
Save the provided JavaScript code in a file named your-script.js, or choose a different filename.

Open the HTML file in a web browser that supports the Intersection Observer API.

Customization
You can customize the behavior of the Intersection Observer by modifying the following options in the code:

root: The element that is used as the viewport for checking visibility. By default, it is set to null, which corresponds to the browser viewport.
rootMargin: Sets the margin around the root element. You can adjust this value to trigger the callback function when the target element is partially visible.
threshold: Determines the visibility threshold at which the callback function is triggered. By default, it is set to 0.01, meaning that the callback is triggered when 1% of the target element is visible.
Feel free to experiment with these options to customize the behavior of the Intersection Observer to suit your needs.

Callback Function
The callback function in the code is called whenever the visibility of the target element changes. You can modify this function to perform specific actions or apply styles to the target element based on its visibility.

entry.isIntersecting: Represents whether the target element is currently intersecting with the root element.
entry.target.classList.add('visible_class'): Adds the visible_class CSS class to the target element when it becomes visible. You can modify this line to apply your own styles or perform other actions.
Acknowledgements
This code is a basic implementation of the Intersection Observer API and can serve as a starting point for more advanced projects. It utilizes the browser's built-in Intersection Observer API.
